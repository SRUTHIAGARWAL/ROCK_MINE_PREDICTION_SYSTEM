Rock vs Mine Prediction System:

The Rock vs Mine Prediction System is a machine learning project that classifies sonar signals to determine whether an object is a rock (R) or a mine (M). Using Logistic Regression, the system learns patterns from sonar data to make accurate predictions, which is useful for underwater safety and naval defense.

Overview:

Sonar technology sends sound waves underwater and records the reflections. Rocks and mines reflect these waves differently, which is captured in the dataset as 60 numerical features per sample. By analyzing these features, the Logistic Regression model calculates the probability that a given sonar reading belongs to either class (Rock or Mine) and then classifies it accordingly.

Dataset : The dataset contains sonar signal readings with 60 features per object.

Labels:

R → Rock
M → Mine
The dataset file is included in the data/ folder as sonar_data.csv.

How It Works

Data Loading: The CSV dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets.
Model Training: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
Evaluation: Model performance is measured using accuracy on both training and test data.
Prediction: The model can predict whether a new sonar reading corresponds to a rock or a mine.

Usage
Load the dataset from the data/ folder.
Train the Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn.
Use model.predict() to classify new sonar inputs.

Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying sonar signals and can reliably differentiate rocks from mines based on their sonar patterns.

Notes

Ensure the dataset is placed in the data/ folder.
Feature scaling is optional for this dataset.
Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems.
